London is sensibly demanding, and after spending a few days there I began to notice how difficult it is to keep up with my typical traveling pace. It's not like the city one day became boring, but having the entire bucket list checked out does not help with finding new activities quickly. One of the key aspects of travel is to know when to rest, so I decided to spend an entire day on leisure and entertainment. What better day to observe Londoners resting than on Sunday?

### Hyde Park

#### The French Gardens

I started my day by grabbing a drink at a convenience store and taking a tube to Hyde Park. It was 10 in the morning, and as a hiking enthusiast, I thought I was already too late to rest from the enormous crowds of London. What a big surprise was awaiting me right after I crossed the gate -  no cars parked, no people - just me and beautiful nature. I took a few steps in and another surprise - no skyscrapers, all tall buildings covered from my eyesight by trees. Most people who wanted to rest took a few steps away and celebrated shade sitting under a tree, whereas others were enjoying large flat greens playing football. 

#### The Serpentine Bridge

#### The Arch by Henry Moore

The photo you see right above lacks any major movement, the water is still, and a single person is crossing the bridge - a major roadway that splits Hyde Park in half - doesn't seem like you're in the center of the biggest city in Europe. I took on a few possibilities to talk with the people nearby and everybody was very keen on small talk, especially on cheering ducks to come and bite our fingers.

After visiting The Imperial College and The Science Museum I fortunately found another interesting square right back of the building. I bought a coffee nearby and sat down under one of the trees waiting to meet my friend, who was coming from a different part of the city. I observed the kids playing football and two old men having a deep philosophical conversation.

#### Speakers' Corner

Imagine you had a problem with something in your country: the politics, high taxation of the poor, or how the government is unable to resolve the immigration crisis. Speaker's Corner offered every attendee a right to speak publicly about *almost* everything - as long as you have something to stand on. The photo below shows a man standing atop the ladder, claiming his right to challenge his opinions.

#### The Prince's Gardens

While we are waiting for my friend to join us, take a look at another precious building I've found in Mayfair. The architect had an interesting point of connecting nature with modern glass and metal, and I think he succeded in keeping it in phase with the other elevations. A more nature-oriented neighborhood by Hunderwasser can be seen in Vienna.
