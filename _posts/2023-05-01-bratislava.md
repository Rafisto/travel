### Slovakian Capital

Bratislava is an interesting city mainly due to its location, it borders both Austria and Czechia. 
Many new infrastructure projects are under development. The money flow caused by the EU market unification,
and switching to Euro is visible in the new business district. The closeness to Vienna also enables a comfortable
and cheap overnight stay opportunities while travelling - tourists sleep in Slovakia and in the morning take a 30 minute train to Vienna.

Above there is a photo showing the view from the Bratislava Castle with the camera pointing at the Austrian border. During the soviet era the forest was a demilitarized zone and the Danube - the river was the border between the two countries. After the collapse of the USSR the Slovakian government decided to keep the area green and allow the public to have a bit of nature nearby the center. The wind turbines in the background, already in Austria, belong to the outskirts of Vienna.

### Bratislava Castle

However fancy or extravagant it may sound in the XXI century, the slovakian government decided to build the castle 
to house their country offices - on the other side of the parliament. The castle is open to the public until 10PM, which
makes it perfect for romantic walks, and during my stay I indeed saw a lot of couples around.

### City architecture

Because of the vicinity to Vienna and Krakow, the architecture of the old town is visibly referring to their typical arches and hallways. Some elevations take their inspiration from the Viennese order. However the whole city maintains its rather cozy and calm
atmosphere, which unfortunately is changing in favor of many high-rise buildings being built as a part of the foreign investments.

### Slovakian cuisine

Irresistibly I must compare Slovak dishes to the Polish ones. They really love to put cheese in almost any national dish. I was tempted
to try some of them such as `Brynzove Halusky so Slanikou`, a photo of which you can see right down below.
