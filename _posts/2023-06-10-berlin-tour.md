### Background

The longest summer break once again invited me to travel. I chose Berlin, a city close to where I live. I have been there before, 
however without any tourism-related activites. To lower the costs of an overnight stay I decided on a one day trip to cover most of
the iconic places, while still on a budget. I took a bus and at 9 AM I had my German dream come true. 
I could finally test my german speaking and comprehension abilities.

### Berlin

Berlin is the capital of Germany, marked with recent history to an extent of being politically split in half for over 40 years.
The Berlin wall as I know it from the books has become a symbol - the end of the soviet era. The new goverment has decided not to
completely buldoze the wall and instead keep a tiny segment, known as the East Side Gallery.

### East Side Gallery

The most iconic view of the East Side Gallery. It was very crowded and there were a lot of souvenir stores nearby. It checks out
every point to become a tourist trap - a few metro stations away from the historic part of the city and a big bus stop.
The passengers are thrown away to view a painted piece of wall, 15 minute break and then they hop on the bus driving them to the center.
Not necessarily a comfortable experience, at least they don't slow drive along the wall. Parts of the Berlin wall are still sold in postcards,
plastic or resin displays - the ubiquity of the souvenir is undeniable.

### Center

Prussian Berlin was built to amaze, but also terrify in its scale. The bulidings and the spaces between then, for example *Reichstaggebaude* (Parliament Building) and *Berlin Hauptbahnhof* (Berlin Main Railway Station) are siginificant. Berlin was home to the biggest office building, right before Nicolae
Chaucauescu decided to build its palace.

### Brandenburger Tor

The most iconic part of Berlin had once been almost entirely covered by the wall, an approach had therefore not been possibleq. 
Fortunately it changed, and from what I saw during the brief walk - Berliners take use of this freedom. The front part of the gate became
a place similar to the London Speakers' Corner. I was in Berlin a few times after my first stay and almost always there were some extremists screaming about either the laws being broken, or radically displaying their affection towards different minorities. However the place is rather safe with a lot of police patrols around.

Turning head to the right of this frame, shows the road leading to the Potsdamer Platz. The road is wide and the buildings in the background are tall, especially the skyscraper with the DB (Deutsche Bahn) logo. On the asphalt one can see stone remainings which were once the border splitting the city in half.

### The Museum Island

When the Prussian revolution had taken its toll on the previous political system, the countries west of Germany were not satisfied with the change. The Prussians had first replaced the elites for their own benefit and then, to curry favour with the West, they started building a new foundation for the german culture. I saw a direct architectural result of this deep approach - The Museum Island, which houses the most important museums in Berlin. The Berlin Cathedral is also located on the island. The Humboldt Forum is a new building, which had been built on the site of the former Berlin City Palace. The palace was destroyed during the war and the East German goverment decided to demolish the ruins. The new building is a gallery of non-european ar, housing the Ethnological Museum and the Museum of Asian Art. The building has been finished in 2020.
