### City of Hradec Kralove

Hradec Kralove is a city in the middle of Czechia. The location is excellent, not too far from Prague and not too far from Poland. 
It is a great place to meet with friends and have a good time together. It has some green areas and parks, a nice city center with a cathedral and a main square.
Take a look at the best photo I took during my visit.

### Arrival

The city is easily accessible by bus and train. There are bus connections to Prague and Warsaw. The bus station is in the center, and the train station is just two blocks away.
One can easily walk from the train station to the city center. There is a free-of-charge bus connection between the train station and the bus station for those who do not want to walk.

The architecture of the main bus terminal is quite interesting - a modern building with a lot of glass and steel. If it wasn't all between the buildings, it would look like an airport terminal.
Overall the terminal is very clean and well maintained, a great place to wait for a bus. There is a special waiting area for international buses.

### City Center

The main square is almost equivalent to every other square in Czechia. It has a church in the center, a fountain, and a statue of a famous person. The only thing I don't understand is why the local government decided to put a parking lot in the middle of the triangular-shaped square. It just doesn't fit the overall look of the square.

Above you can see the backside - a part of the square emerging from the church. During my visit in July, this small area behind the church had a nice shade. There are quite a few restaurants and cafes around to enjoy.

As we went further from the main square, we found this building. It turned out to be the main office building of Hradec Kralove. It is a nice building with a fountain and the statue of the first president of Czechia - Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk. He was the first president of Czechoslovakia from 1918 to 1935, a philosopher, and a politician. Born in 1850 and died in 1937.

We also went to a shopping mall to try out some Czech fast food and to buy some groceries. What intrigued me the most was the Ikea store inside the shopping mall. Never seen this kind of Ikea store. Deeming from the text on the sign there's a planning studio inside, where people can decide on their room layouts for future furniture and appliances.

### City Park

Finishing the day in the city park. The most beautiful photo of it I put at the beginning of this post. The park has a pond and a dozen tiny bridges and pathways. Perfect to walk around, enjoy nature, and relax with friends. I rate this park as one of the best I've seen in Czechia.
